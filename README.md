/// put in instructions for getting mysql, schema and seeds 

When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
